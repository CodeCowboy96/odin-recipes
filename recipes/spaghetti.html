    <h2>Description</h2>
    Spaghetti is a timeless italian classic that can be made very simply and quickly. 
    In this recipe we'll be using store bought noodles but if you wish to make your own, 
    you can learn to do so easily <a href="https://www.loveandlemons.com/homemade-pasta-recipe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Spaghetti-</strong>a box of your favorite brand will suite fine. I prefer whole wheat for extra nutritional value</li>
            <li><strong>Tomato Sauce-</strong>make sure it is tomato sauce as we're going to season it ourselves</li>
            <li><strong>Parmesan Cheese-</strong>the parmesan in a shake can will suffice but if you really want to excite your taste buds grab a fresh block of cheese and grate it yourself</li>
            <li><strong>Garlic-</strong>be sure to have a good amount of minced  garlic as this is what we will use to make our 'homemade' spaghetti sauce</li>
            <li><strong>Olive Oil-</strong>Use quality extra virgin for best flavor</li>
            <li><strong>Dried Oregano, Salt, and Pepper-</strong>a simple seasoning mix will suffice</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Cook Spaghetti:</strong>Fill a large pot with cold water and bring to a boil. 
                Add 2 teaspoons of salt the spaghetti.make sure to stir occasionally to prevent noodles from sticking together.
                Cook for 7 minutes until al dente.</li>
            <li><strong>Drain Pasta:</strong>Check spaghetti for doneness by grabbing one strand and testing it yourself. 
                Make sure pasta doesn't get to soft as the key to good pasta is a bite.Drain in a strainer in the sink.</li>
            <li><strong>Cook Garlic:</strong>Return pot to medium heat and add olive oil, 4 garlic cloves, and oregano. Garlic cooks fast so be careful.
                 Turn off heat.</li>
            <li><strong>Add Remaining Ingredients:</strong>Combine drained spaghetti, tomato sauce, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, black pepper,
                 and 1 more fresh garlic clove in the same pot. Stir until warm throughout.
                Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top and serve.</li>
        </ol>
